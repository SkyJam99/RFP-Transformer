More importantly, the project leads from Transnomis are former users of operation centre software and will help guide the design process to ensure that the product is built with the user in mind. During the Current State Evaluation project phase, user requirements will be recorded and documented. These user requirements may go beyond the Proposal\u2019s objective requirements, and there will be flexibility to include desired features beyond that of the existing system. Operators may have insight into the existing system, and provide requests such as dark mode dashboards, additional safeguards/verifications, or other features that were not specified in the original RFP. These HHB and HHB operator insights and suggestions will be recorded and tempered against the existing system framework, technical constraints, and practicality, then used as an input during the Implementation phase. Every effort will be used to ensure the system maintains its reputation as being user friendly and easy to learn. The insights and suggestions from that engagement will be used as the basis for later user evaluation. Mock-ups will be shared with HHB and will include 'what we heard' from the engagement session. HHB will be asked to review and ensure that the mock-ups and the 'what we heard' suggestions and insights are reflective of the user\u2019s needs. As the system is being built and implemented, informal demos will be performed, particularly when the Software Project Manager is looking for further input on specific features. A formal System Demo is scheduled after the completion of primary development. This System Demo includes basic training, and a walk through of the features. HHB will be given access to use and test the system and provide feedback. A series of questions will be provided to HHB to survey their opinions on the system, guided by the original input from the engagement and Detailed Design. We have allocated one week for HHB to use the system, ask questions, and provide feedback. The feedback from this System Demo period will be used to guide final changes and system tweaks to ensure the system meets the needs of HHB. During the Go-Live periods, Transnomis staff will be on-hand to observe how HHB operations staff use TMaCS, and take note on any opportunity for improvements. Transnomis staff can directly address any questions and issues immediately. Urgently required changes will be made in an expedited fashion. Most importantly, the project team is highly experienced and have direct hands-on operational experience in traffic management centres and with lane reversal systems, as well as in building software for users."

Any issues related to sensor position, height or alignment will be detected early, providing the team with the opportunity to rectify the test site before installing other sensors. Due to the safety concerns associated with working on the Skyway, it is important that sensor installations are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. The test site will allow future sensor installations to be completed with reliability such that field crews will not need to return to make adjustments. Regular system testing will allow the team to discover and solve previously unknown issues, provide Transnomis a head start on software development and refine the project teams testing procedure for the remaining sensors. A sensor test site will be installed early into the contract for system testing and discovery. We believe this approach helped lead to the success of the QSVAS project."

As additional features are developed and released, the user guide will be updated. In addition to the user manual, a small number of Quick Reference Instructions will be created upon request. These Quick Reference guides are simple step-by-step instructions, to cover specific common tasks that GNWT encounters, such as 'How do I create a report of malfunctioning devices?' or 'How do I disable all VMS'? Typically, 5-10 Quick Reference Instructions are created for the most common or complicated tasks."

Training During Implementation: A new transportation information reporting system with many system integrations and data layers can take time for the users to get comfortable with all features and capabilities. We firmly believe that the off-the-shelf capabilities of the ITS central software are easy to use for users and, therefore, intend to provide short demos and trainings to GNWT project team as the software is being developed. This approach has 2 advantages: 1. It helps GNWT team members to get access to start using the off-the-shelf capabilities as soon the first phase of software implementation is complete (approximately 6 months before the final project completion). This gives more time for GNWT team members to familiarize themselves with the system and to raise questions or issues. 2. The development team gets feedback from GNWT project team for improvements in next iterations of software development."
