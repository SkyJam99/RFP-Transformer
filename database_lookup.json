        "answer_text": "A total of 3 servers, hosted professionally by OVH within Canada, will be utilized in this project to achieve full system triple redundancy and fail-over. OVH has technician and security on-site 24/7. It has systematic double power supply, 250 kVA UPS and generators with an initial autonomy of 48 hours. It has a minimum of 2 network connections and two network rooms within each of its data centers. In addition to the primary server, an identical software installation will be created in two additional servers \u2013 one for failover and one for hot spare. The database will be set up with streaming replication such that the databases in all three (3) servers will always be in sync. In the event the primary server fails, the secondary server can quickly and automatically take over to become the primary server."

        "answer_text": "The Watch Dog process will ensure that between the primary and secondary servers, ITS Central will be highly available with no more than 10 minutes downtime should there be any system failures with the primary server. Database replication is a built-in feature of PostgreSQL. In particular, PostgreSQL supports Logical Replication. Logical replication allows fine-grained control over both data replication and security. Logical replication uses a publish and subscribe model with one or more subscribers subscribing to one or more publications on a publisher node."
